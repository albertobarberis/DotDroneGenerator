      Dot Drone Generator is a drone generator which allows you to create synthetic textures and chords directly on your browser. 
      <br><br>
      Click on the window to generate a Dot, which has a sinusoidal wave with tremolo. 
      <br><br>
      The y-axis represents the amplitude range. The amplitude is modulated by a  triangular LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator), with a random frequency. 
      <br><br>
      The x-axis represents the frequency range. 
      <br><br>
      Press 'L' and then Click+Drag from an existing Dot to an other one, to link two sinusoids and create a Frequency Modulation (FM synthesis) between them, where the first Dot becomes (in addition) the modulator of the second (carrier). 
      <br><br>
      It is possible to create a chain of modulation: each carrier can become a modulator. This allows you to create complex spectra with a lot of sidebands, to the point of creating very noisy sounds! 
      <br><br>
      Click on an existing circle to delete it or to delete the modulation chain of which it is part.
